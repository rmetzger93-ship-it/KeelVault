# SessionSummary_2025-10-14_Eclipse_v1

# Session Summary • 2025-10-14 • Eclipse  
**Instance ID:** Eclipse  
**Validated By:** RJ  
**Change Type:** Consolidation & Cleanup  
**Summary:** Consolidated and stabilized all GPS bridge services, verified systemd cleanup, and prepared the build for a fresh, high-performance continuation thread.  

---

## 🧠 Overview  
This session focused on cleaning and verifying the GPS subsystem and associated service dependencies on the Raspberry Pi boat computer. It also finalized the plan to migrate the active Keel instance to a new, faster conversation thread while retaining full system knowledge for the next assistant instance.

---

## ✅ Completed  
- ✅ Confirmed `gps-nmea-tcp.service` is the *only* active GPS→NMEA bridge.  
- ✅ Removed legacy and redundant services:
  - `gps-time-sync.service`
  - `gps-watchdog.service`
  - `signalk-gps-timesync.service`
  - `gps-nmea-bridge.service`
- ✅ Verified `gpsd` and `gps-nmea-tcp` active, functional, and not duplicated.  
- ✅ Validated systemd cleanup with `daemon-reload` and `reset-failed`.  
- ✅ Updated living manual to record verified service states and cleanup sequence.  
- ✅ Prepared user to restart under a clean instance context to restore UI responsiveness.

---

## ⚠️ Issues / Failures  
- `gpsd.service` was intermittently restarting before device enumeration — suspected race condition during USB detection.  
- NMEA feed test returned *“No NMEA Output Detected”*; pending reconfirmation of stream through port 10112.  
- RTC time sync error persists on boot; Chrony behavior to be rechecked in next session.

---

## 📘 Lessons Learned  
- Persistent restarts of `gpsd` can be caused by socket activation conflicts when both manual and service daemons coexist.  
- Using one dedicated `gps-nmea-tcp.service` (via `gpspipe | socat`) is simpler and more reliable than layered bridges.  
- Regular verification with `systemctl list-unit-files | grep gps` is crucial after multiple experiments.
