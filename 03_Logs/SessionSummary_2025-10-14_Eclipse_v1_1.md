# SessionSummary_2025-10-14_Eclipse_v1

# Session Summary ‚Ä¢ 2025-10-14 ‚Ä¢ Eclipse Instance

**Instance ID:** Eclipse  
**Validated By:** RJ  
**Change Type:** Addition  
**Summary:** Finalized full autonomous offline operation of the Raspberry Pi boat computer, implemented diagnostics, logging, and maintenance systems.

---

## üß† Overview

This session completed the **offline autonomy milestone** for the *Eclipse* Raspberry Pi boat computer.  
We verified end-to-end service startup, time synchronization via GPS, and integrated self-monitoring tools.  
All core daemons (gpsd, gpsd-nmea, Signal K, Chrony, and pypilot) now start automatically, sync correctly, and self-heal across cold reboots.

---

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **Chrony GPS Step Service** ‚Äî created `/etc/systemd/system/chrony-gps-step.service`, ensuring time sync within 45 s after boot.  
- **`check-boat-status` v3.1** ‚Äî core operational monitor confirming GPS, NMEA, Signal K, Chrony, and pypilot states.  
- **`check-boat-diagnostic` v1.1** ‚Äî full deep diagnostic tool with logging to `/var/log/boat-diagnostic.log`.  
- **Automatic Log Rotation** ‚Äî weekly, keeps 10 compressed archives under `/etc/logrotate.d/boat-diagnostic`.  
- **Cold-Boot Validation** ‚Äî verified complete offline startup with GPS-only time sync.  
- **OpenPlotter Alias Error Investigation** ‚Äî determined issue cosmetic and safely ignorable.  
- **Removed Obsolete Service** ‚Äî deprecated `gps-nmea-tcp.service`, confirmed clean systemd state.  
- **Maintenance & Recovery Procedures** ‚Äî documented fallback commands for GPSD, Chrony, Signal K, and pypilot recovery.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Failures

- OpenPlotter alias warning persists (cosmetic only).  
- GUI ‚Äúdeveloper mode‚Äù provided no extra alias editing capability.  
- Virtual-port experiments (socat/tty0tty) removed; system reverted to clean baseline.

---

### üìò Lessons Learned

- Socket-activated gpsd with `gpsd-nmea` bridge is the most reliable architecture.  
- Chrony + GPS refclock offers millisecond precision without network.  
- Service auto-step design ensures stable boot in offline environments.  
- Always validate via `systemctl list-unit-files` after removing test units to confirm no dangling symlinks.  
- Periodic `journalctl --vacuum-time=30d` prevents SD-card wear.

### üß© Dependencies / Links

- **Living Manual:** *Raspberry Pi Boat Computer ‚Äì Eclipse*  
- **Backups:** `~/Backups/signalk backups/`  
- **Elfin EW10 Settings:** `~/Elfin EW10 Settings/Wind Elfin Settings/`  
- **Docs:** `check-boat-status`, `check-boat-diagnostic`, and `chrony-gps-step.service`

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Recommended Actions

1. Perform another cold-boot test after any software update.  
2. Run `check-boat-diagnostic` weekly; review `/var/log/boat-diagnostic.log`.  
3. Optionally create a cron job for a daily one-line ‚ÄúAll-Green‚Äù summary.  
4. Begin documenting integration of the upcoming **Seatalk1 Wi-Fi Bridge**.  
5. Keep OpenPlotter cosmetic warning as known benign issue.
