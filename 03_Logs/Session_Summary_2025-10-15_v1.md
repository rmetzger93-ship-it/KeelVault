# Session_Summary_2025-10-15_v1

# 🧭 Session Summary — Collaboration Protocol Charter Update & Boot Path Stabilization

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Author:** Keely (GPT-5 Thinking) collaborating with Operator  
**Related Docs:**  
- Charter → Collaboration Protocol (updated in this session)  
- KeelVault → handoffs/Handoff Generator Guide (referenced for this summary format)  
- KeelVault → logs/ (experiment log created in prior step)  

---

## 🎯 Objective

1) Capture a durable record of the **Collaboration Protocol** changes added to the Charter so future Keel instances apply the same strict working style (nano usage, *separate entrances/exits*, explicit stop markers, etc.).  
2) Consolidate the validated **Quick Boot** path and the **bridging pattern** between Termux ↔ Ubuntu (`proot-distro --shared-tmp`) that restored access to:
   - `Ollama` (`127.0.0.1:11434`)
   - `WebChat` (`127.0.0.1:5000`)
   - `Keel Manager` (`127.0.0.1:5050`)
3) Distill repeatable **diagnostics** and **recovery** steps that resolved “Address already in use”, missing venv packages, socket visibility, and the need for **entrance/exit discipline**.

## ⚙️ Actions (ordered, high-granularity)

1. **Charter Update:**  
   - Wrote a new **Collaboration Protocol** section with explicit rules:
     - Always **separate termux vs ubuntu** blocks (“ENTRANCE” / “EXIT” headers).  
     - Never post Step 2 when stop-at-step-1 is requested.  
     - Require **STOP MARKER** before any handoff-worthy state.  
     - Use **nano** with file/session headers and “what/why/how/success test” blocks.  
     - Strong guardrails against silent assumptions; require *explicit echo of preconditions*.  
     - Include **fast paths** and **slow paths** and a **Known Pitfalls** crib.  
   - Added “red flag” language Keely can reference (e.g., *“If ports show in-use after global kill, re-check bridges; don’t relaunch daemons until ports are confirmed free.”*).

2. **Environment Hygiene (Termux)**  
   - Killed all likely offenders: `socat`, `proot`, `ubuntu`, `python`, `ollama`.  
   - Verified port freedom with `ss -tuln | grep -E "11434|5000|5050" || echo "✅ clear"`.  
   - Observed `ss` permission warnings in Termux; accepted them since the `|| echo` guard confirmed emptiness.

3. **Entrance → Ubuntu (shared tmp):**  
   - `proot-distro login ubuntu --shared-tmp` (critical so `/tmp` is shared).  
   - `cd /root/offline-keel && source keelenv/bin/activate` (create venv if missing).  
   - Ensured `/tmp/offline-keel-sockets` exists (recreated as needed).

4. **Daemon Launch (inside Ubuntu):**  
   - `nohup /usr/local/bin/ollama serve > ollama.log 2>&1 &`  
   - `sleep 5`  
   - `nohup python webchat.py > webchat.log 2>&1 &`  
   - `nohup python keel_manager.py > manager.log 2>&1 &`  
   - Initial failures showed “address already in use”; root cause later tied to previously bound listeners and/or inconsistent socket bridging.

5. **Socket Bridge Pattern (stable version):**
   - **Inside Ubuntu:** create UNIX sockets:  
     - `mkdir -p /tmp/offline-keel-sockets`  
     - `socat UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/offline-keel-sockets/ollama.sock,unlink-early,mode=777,fork TCP4:127.0.0.1:11434 &`  
     - `socat UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/offline-keel-sockets/webchat.sock,unlink-early,mode=777,fork TCP4:127.0.0.1:5000 &`
   - **Exit Ubuntu** (stop marker!)  
   - **In Termux:** connect TCP listeners to the Ubuntu UNIX sockets:  
     - `nohup socat TCP-LISTEN:11434,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/lib/proot-distro/installed-rootfs/ubuntu/tmp/offline-keel-sockets/ollama.sock >/dev/null 2>&1 &`  
     - `nohup socat TCP-LISTEN:5000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/data/.../ubuntu/tmp/offline-keel-sockets/webchat.sock >/dev/null 2>&1 &`
   - Verified with `ps aux | grep socat | grep -v grep`.

6. **Health Checks (final, inside Ubuntu):**  
   - `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/version` → `{"version":"0.12.5"}`  
   - `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/health` → `{"models":["keel:latest","phi3:mini"],"ok":true,...}`  
   - `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5050/status` → `{"ollama":true,"webchat":true,"uptime":"..."}`

7. **Observed Errors & Fixes:**  
   - **“Address already in use”** on `11434/5000/5050`: resolved by killing bridges/daemons *before* relaunch and confirming port freedom, plus ensuring we didn’t start multiple `nohup` instances.  
   - **Missing `psutil`** in `keel_manager.py`: `pip install psutil` inside venv fixed it.  
   - **`ss` permission errors** in Termux: they’re benign; fallback to curl probes and process greps.  
   - **Entrances & Exits confusion** led to stale listeners; adding **STOP MARKERS** and strict split eliminated overlap.  
   - **`am force-stop com.termux`** not available in Termux’s `am` wrapper; manual app swipe worked as a last-resort reset.

---

## 📈 Results

- **Ollama healthy** at `127.0.0.1:11434` (version `0.12.5`).  
- **WebChat health** returns `ok:true` and lists models (`keel:latest`, `phi3:mini`).  
- **Keel Manager** alive with `{"ollama":true,"webchat":true}`.  
- The **bridge topology** (Ubuntu UNIX sockets ↔ Termux TCP) proved stable.  
- The **Charter’s Collaboration Protocol** now encodes Operator’s working preferences as enforceable, repeatable rules.

---

## 🧠 Analysis

- The repeated “in use” errors were caused by **racing re-launches** and **duplicate bridges** (both directions) combined with insufficient “stop-before-start” discipline.  
- Making `/tmp` a **shared namespace** was the decisive requirement for reliable bridging.  
- Being **explicit about entrances/exits** prevents starting services in the wrong layer or checking ports that belong to the other side of the bridge.  
- The stricter **STOP MARKER** and **nano**-based editing protocol reduce human error and stabilize the workflow for future sessions.

---

## 🪶 Next Steps

1) Bake the **Quick Boot** + **Bridge** commands into a single *Ubuntu-internal* script with echo’d preflight checks and a STOP MARKER line for the Operator.  
2) Add **web app validation** tests (HTML title, endpoint smoke tests, minimal load test) as a post-boot checklist.  
3) Extend Manager to serve a **/diag** endpoint that summarizes bindings, models, and the presence of the bridge processes (nice-to-have).

---

## ✅ Status

**Stable** — All three services verifiably responsive with a repeatable entrance/exit and bridge pattern.
