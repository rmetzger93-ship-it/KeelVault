# SessionSummary_2025-10-14_EclipseInstance_v1

# Session Summary ‚Ä¢ 2025-10-14 ‚Ä¢ EclipseInstance  
**Instance ID:** EclipseInstance  
**Validated By:** RJ  
**Change Type:** Addition  
**Summary:** Completed extensive troubleshooting and documentation of OpenPlotter GPS alias integration, culminating in full system restoration and archival in the Experiments & Diagnostics Archive.

---

## üß† Overview  
This session focused on resolving the persistent ‚Äúno alias assigned‚Äù warning within OpenPlotter Serial for the gpsd-controlled u-blox USB GPS. Multiple experimental paths were explored to test the system‚Äôs behavior around device aliasing, udev rules, and internal OpenPlotter enumeration. The work concluded with a full rollback to verified operational state and archival of the entire experiment under the *Experiments & Diagnostics Archive* section of the living system manual.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed  
- Explored three major approaches to resolving the cosmetic alias error:  
  1. **Virtual Serial Bridge** using `socat` and pseudo-TTY devices.  
  2. **Direct Metadata Injection** via custom udev rules to fake USB descriptors.  
  3. **Internal Patch Test** modifying OpenPlotter‚Äôs `serialPorts.py`.  
- Verified interaction between `gpsd`, `gpsd-nmea`, and `signalk` post-change.  
- Created and tested a temporary systemd unit: `/etc/systemd/system/gpsd-virtual-bridge.service`.  
- Confirmed the following key service chain remains stable after all reversions:  
  - `/dev/gps-ublox` ‚Üí `/dev/ttyACM0`  
  - `gpsd.socket` active and listening on `127.0.0.1:2947`  
  - `gpsd-nmea.service` broadcasting NMEA sentences on port **10120**  
  - `signalk.service` consuming live GPS data successfully.  
- Restored baseline OpenPlotter Serial package via reinstall command:

sudo apt reinstall openplotter-serial -y

- Validated syntax and GUI load with:

openplotter-serial &

- Confirmed successful cleanup:

ls -l /dev/ttyACM* /dev/gps-ublox nc 127.0.0.1 10120 | head -n 3

- Added experiment log entry under **Experiments & Diagnostics Archive** in the living manual.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Failures  
- OpenPlotter‚Äôs Serial GUI ignores symbolic and virtual TTYs (`socat pty`) for alias assignment.  
- Internal script modification caused a `KeyError: 'enabled'` due to mismatched data structure.  
- Direct alias injection not possible while `gpsd` retains device control.  
- Cosmetic alias issue persists (non-impacting functionality).

---

## üìò Lessons Learned  
- OpenPlotter Serial strictly enumerates hardware-backed `/dev/tty*` devices via kernel events.  
- Cosmetic warnings in Serial GUI have no operational bearing on gpsd or Signal K.  
- Safe system reversion procedures now established:  
- Disable service ‚Üí remove bridge ‚Üí reload udev/systemd ‚Üí confirm device rebind.  
- Maintaining a *self-contained archive of experiments* prevents re-looping and accelerates future diagnostics.

---

## üß© Dependencies / Links  
- **System Services:** `gpsd`, `gpsd-nmea`, `signalk`  
- **Manuals Referenced:** Living System Manual ‚Üí *Experiments & Diagnostics Archive*  
- **üîí Private References (Keep):** udev alias paths, GPS vendor IDs, OpenPlotter configs.

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Recommended Actions  
1. Investigate *external alias registration plugin* concept to provide GUI-readable alias metadata without modifying OpenPlotter internals.  
2. Continue migrating all experiment records to the **Experiments & Diagnostics Archive**.  
3. When stable, produce a summarized ‚ÄúSystem Integrity Snapshot‚Äù for baseline comparison after future upgrades.
