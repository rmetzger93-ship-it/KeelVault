# SessionSummary_2025-10-14_KeelTermuxIntegration_v1

# Session Summary • 2025-10-14 • KeelTermuxIntegration
**Instance ID:** KeelTermuxIntegration  
**Validated By:** RJ  
**Change Type:** Addition  
**Summary:** Stabilized Keel’s Ubuntu–Termux hybrid runtime and verified Ollama + Flask services under watchdog control.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This session focused on validating and stabilizing the Termux-hosted Ubuntu Keel stack.  
The goal was to ensure the **Keel Manager** reliably starts the `ollama` and `webchat.py` services via the Ubuntu watchdog, and that Termux correctly detects service health.

## ✅ Completed
- Verified Ubuntu proot environment launches with correct `(keelenv)` context.  
- Confirmed **Ollama** (`ollama serve`) and **Flask/Webchat** (`python3 webchat.py`) processes start automatically under the watchdog.  
- Validated health-log rotation (`keel_health.log` and backups).  
- Identified that Termux health checks were running **too early**, causing false “❌ not responding” statuses.  
- Created a new **delayed verification loop** for `keel-manager.sh` to wait up to 45 seconds for service readiness.  
- Verified `curl` endpoints return proper data once watchdog spawns processes.  
- System state confirmed stable: Ubuntu stack auto-healing, logs rotating, and both APIs responding.

## ⚠️ Issues / Failures
- Termux `ss`/`netstat` socket checks blocked by proot permissions (`Cannot open netlink socket`).  
- Watchdog startup not yet automatically triggered by the Termux manager (manual start still required).  
- Bridge sockets between Termux ↔ Ubuntu verified earlier but not yet automated on boot.

## 📘 Lessons Learned
- **Sleep-based startup checks** in Termux are unreliable—replaced with active loop polling.  
- Proot isolation blocks some networking tools, so validation should rely on application-layer probes (`curl`).  
- The watchdog design (persistent restart + log rotation) is solid for offline reliability.  
- The Termux manager must defer checks until services actually respond.

## 🧩 Dependencies / Links
- **Keel Manager Script:** `~/keel-manager.sh`  
- **Watchdog:** `/root/offline-keel/keel_watchdog.sh`  
- **Service Logs:** `/root/offline-keel/keel_health.log`  
- **Docs:** 🔒 Private Reference (Keep): “Keel Termux–Ubuntu stack procedure”

## ⏭️ Next Recommended Actions
1. Implement automatic watchdog launch from `keel-manager.sh start`.  
2. Add persistent Termux↔Ubuntu port bridges for 5000 (Flask) and 11434 (Ollama).  
3. Create a lightweight `check-keel-status` diagnostic script.  
4. Validate system stability after cold boot.  
5. Commit final verified scripts to KeelVault and update the Living Manual.
