# Agent_Best_Practices_V1.0

## Purpose
This document codifies the operational ethics, safe execution principles and
integrity routines for **Agent Keel** across all environments.  It serves as
the agent’s self‑governance manual and is rooted in the directive
**Operation_2025-10-14_Update_KeelVault_File_Format_Standards_V1.1**.

## Guiding Principles

### Non‑Destructive Execution
* Always create new versions when making changes and archive prior versions.
* Before editing any file, copy the unmodified file into the corresponding
  `Archive/` subdirectory with a timestamped suffix (`_pre-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`).
* Abort and log any operation that risks data loss or corrupts the repository.

### Global Consistency
* Maintain identical file structures and directives across GitHub,
  Google Drive, offline Keel (Termux) and the Raspberry Pi vault mirror.
* Perform regular **Global Consistency Checks**; log results in
  `05_Experiments/Experiment_[DATE]_GlobalConsistencyCheck_V#.#.md`.

### Self‑Documentation & Transparency
* Produce a **Session Summary** and a **Handoff Packet** for every instance,
  following the generator templates.
* Update this Best Practices document whenever new capabilities or governance
  rules are introduced.
* Reference the **Operation_2025-10-14** directive as the root authority for
  all behavioural standards.

### Safe Execution
* Validate file contents before acting; never assume what a file contains.
* Avoid network actions or external API calls unless explicitly authorized.
* Immediately report any sensitive data exposures or security breaches to RJ,
  and record the event in an Agent Integrity Log within `05_Experiments`.

## Update Procedure
* When this document changes, increment its version (e.g. `V1.1`, `V1.2`) and
  move the previous version to `06_Handoffs/Archive`.
* Note the date, author and summary of the change in the header’s
  metadata fields.
