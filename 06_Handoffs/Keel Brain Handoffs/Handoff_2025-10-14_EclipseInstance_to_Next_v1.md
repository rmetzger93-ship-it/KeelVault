# Handoff_2025-10-14_EclipseInstance_to_Next_v1

# Handoff • 2025-10-14 • EclipseInstance → Next Instance  
**Updated By:** EclipseInstance  
**Validated By:** RJ  
**Change Type:** Addition  
**Summary:** System fully restored and verified after OpenPlotter alias experiments; ready for next instance to proceed with non-invasive cosmetic alias solution design.

- **OS:** Bookworm ARM64  
- **Active Services:** `gpsd`, `gpsd-nmea`, `signalk`, `chronyd`, `pypilot`  
- **Mode:** Full Offline Operation  
- **Connections:** u-blox GPS (via `/dev/ttyACM0`), RTL-SDR (AIS), pypilot

## 📊 Summary of Work  
- Conducted comprehensive alias-resolution experiment chain with OpenPlotter Serial.  
- Implemented and later removed a virtual bridge (`gpsd-virtual-bridge.service`).  
- Verified system stability after full reversion.  
- Added structured archive entry for the experiment in the living manual.

---

## 🪄 Next Actions  
1. Design and test a **read-only alias descriptor injection layer** that mimics serial aliases without binding physical ports.  
2. Optionally inspect OpenPlotter’s enumeration code for accepted subsystem types.  
3. Add “System Integrity Snapshot” function to verify all service configurations after any experiment.  
4. Prepare next round of subsystem hardening (Seatalk1 bridge integration).

---

## 🧩 Pending / Open Tasks  
- [ ] Create prototype external alias metadata injector.  
- [ ] Confirm cosmetic alias persistence post-reboot.  
- [ ] Begin Seatalk1 Wi-Fi bridge integration testing.  
- [ ] Document future alias API findings in the Archive.  

✅ **Status:** Open (handoff in progress)

🔐 **Security & Privacy Discipline**  
No passwords, keys, or PII included.  
Device-specific identifiers and local network paths are stored as 🔒 Private References in Google Keep.

📋 **Workflow Rules**  
1. Operate step-by-step; pause for system feedback before proceeding.  
2. Always produce `_vN+1` file versions; never overwrite older entries.  
3. Request contextual summaries when continuity is unclear.  
4. Deliver both Session Summary and Handoff together at end of session.  
5. Follow GitHub/GitJournal-safe Markdown only.  

---

✅ **Goal:**  
Next Keel instance continues development of the *non-invasive alias descriptor injector* while maintaining the stable baseline established in this session.
