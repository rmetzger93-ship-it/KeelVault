1. Add optional **cron-based daily health summary** to `/etc/cron.d/boat-health`.  
2. Begin configuration for **Seatalk1 Wi-Fi bridge** integration.  
3. Periodically verify GPS fix latency (< 45 s target).  
4. Continue logging cold-boot test results monthly.  
5. When OpenPlotter updates, test if alias error disappears.
