# README_99_Archive_v1.0

# Global Archive Guide (v1.0)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-14  
**Updated By:** Keel  
**Validated By:** RJ  
**Change Type:** Addition  
**Summary:** Provides an overview of the `99_Archive` directory and how archived files are managed across KeelVault.

---

## Purpose
The `99_Archive` folder is the repository‑wide archive for superseded or deprecated files. When a new version of a document is created, the previous version should be moved here or to the appropriate local archive so that history is preserved without cluttering active directories.

---

## Structure
- Subfolders mirror the top‑level directories (e.g., `00_Charter`, `01_Index`) to maintain clear provenance of archived files.
- Within each subfolder, files are stored chronologically or by version number to track their lineage.

---

## Usage
- Do not edit files once they are archived; they are immutable historical records.
- When referencing an old version, link to the file in `99_Archive` and note why it was replaced.
- Keep at least one prior version of every important document; more versions may be kept as needed.
